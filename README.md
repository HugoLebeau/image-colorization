# Automatic image colorization

This is a from scratch implementation of two CNN-based automatic image colorization models:
 * Zhang *et al.* (2016)
 * Su *et al.* (2020)

The first model is used as colorization module in the second model (Su *et al.* use a slightly different architecture) but it works as it is presented in their work (in particular, the fusion module is the same).
